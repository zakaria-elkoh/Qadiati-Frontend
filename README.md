# Project README

## Overview

This project is a modern React-based frontend application designed to provide an intuitive and efficient user experience. The codebase leverages TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind CSS for responsive styling, and several powerful libraries to handle state management, form validation, internationalization, and other core functionalities.

## Technologies Used

### Core Frameworks and Libraries

- **React (v18.3.1)**: The core library for building the user interface.
- **TypeScript (~v5.6.2)**: Adds static typing to the project, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- **Vite (v5.4.10)**: A fast build tool for modern web projects that ensures rapid development and optimized production builds.

### State Management

- **@reduxjs/toolkit (v2.3.0)**: A modern and efficient approach for managing state in React applications.
- **react-redux (v9.1.2)**: Provides React bindings for Redux.

### Form Handling

- **react-hook-form (v7.53.1)**: Simplifies form validation and management.
- **@hookform/resolvers (v3.9.1)**: Connects validation libraries like Zod to `react-hook-form`.

### Validation

- **Zod (v3.23.8)**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library used for form and input validation.

### UI Components

- **lucide-react (v0.454.0)**: Icon library for modern, customizable icons.
- **@radix-ui/react-\* (various)**: Provides a collection of low-level UI components for building accessible design systems.
- **Tailwind CSS (v3.4.14)**: A utility-first CSS framework that makes styling easier and faster.
- **tailwind-merge (v2.5.4)**: Ensures class names in Tailwind CSS are merged without duplication.
- **tailwindcss-animate (v1.0.7)**: Adds animation utilities to Tailwind CSS.

### HTTP Requests

- **Axios (v1.7.7)**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API calls.

### Date and Time Manipulation

- **date-fns (v4.1.0)**: A modern JavaScript date utility library for formatting and manipulating date and time data.

### Internationalization

- **i18next (v23.16.4)**: A framework for handling translations and language detection.
- **react-i18next (v15.1.0)**: Provides React bindings for `i18next` for easy internationalization.

### Utilities

- **clsx (v2.1.1)**: A utility for conditionally joining class names.
- **class-variance-authority (v0.7.0)**: Simplifies handling of className conditionally.

## Development Tools

- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: Adds React support to Vite.
- **TypeScript ESLint (v8.11.0)**: Ensures code adheres to best practices and consistent style.
- **ESLint (v9.13.0)**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript/TypeScript code.
- **PostCSS (v8.4.47)**: Used in conjunction with Tailwind for processing CSS.
- **Autoprefixer (v10.4.20)**: Adds vendor prefixes to CSS for better browser support.
